# Running for the first time

If you do not have nvm installed (node version manager), please install that using the command provided in this link:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script

**NOTE:** Ensure you're in the project root directory, and replace the XX.XX.XX with whichever node version is declared in the .nvmrc

The command should be similar to this:

```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/vXX.XX.XX/install.sh | bash
```

Once NVM has been installed, please restart your terminal.

After terminal restarte, run these set of commands to ensure you're on the matching npm version

```
cd gio-maps
nvm use
nvm install
nvm alias default node
nvm exec
nvm run
nvm which
```

Congrats! Next is to just install and run the project

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

or if you prefer, you can use other package managers like yarn or pnpm

```bash
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
