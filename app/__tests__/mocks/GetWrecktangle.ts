The crust was super soggy and I could barely eat it with out most of the toppings falling off. I suggest to not get a bunch of topping or they need to cook it longer. I prefer my pizza crispy. The bartender was awesome and friendly. The place it self is nice and they had the walls\nOpen to let fresh air in. Lots of beer on tap!",

I have tried both the \"Hawaiian\" style and the cheese and sauce pizzas and both were rather underwhelming for the price. I also ordered the caesar salad both times and I had forgotten until I tasted it again that it has a very strong anchovy flavor that is not my favorite. It's possible that I may forget about these things again and come here in the future, but that won't be for a while.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. Not many people were there when I went most recently, but I hear they do trivia some nights. That may be a slightly redeeming quality.\n\nThe service and staff have been good both times, very friendly and helpful.",
